Each runs approximately 100 m then passes a baton off to the next runner. The idea is to complete the 400m race in the fastest time possible. The key is to minimize the time to pass the baton and to do it at maximum possible speed.<br /><br /> For the purposes of this analysis, you will make several assumptions: <br /> Each runner has a maximum speed of 12 m/s. There is a 20m passing zone. The baton must be passed to the next runner in that zone. The receiving runner waits at the start of the passing zone. This person will accelerate to top speed by the end of the passing zone. The pass of the baton will take place at the end of the passing zone when both runners are at maximum speed. At this point, the incoming runner is only 1 m behind the receiving runner - this is close enough to pass the baton.<br /><br />"

They were to add 20 mL of water to one piece of bread and no water to the other piece of bread. They were also to keep both pieces of bread in a cool, dark place and to make daily observations of the bread. However, Keisha and Sam did not read the lab procedure carefully and they put 20 mL of water on one piece of bread and 40 mL of water on the other piece of bread. <br /><br /> At the conclusion of the experiment, mold had grown on both pieces of their bread.
